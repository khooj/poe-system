#### PoE items custom processing (draft)

The main goal of this project is to learn Rust and it's ecosystem for developing web-services.

At time of writing it can estimate build cost (`application/bin/calc_set.rs` bin) by
querying pathofexile.com/trade API.

I didn't test everything properly as some time ago I decided to
complete it as proof-of-concept which means that some core functionality should work
and more work should be done for it to be usable.
